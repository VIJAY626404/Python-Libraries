       "  'body': 'This PR closes an edge-case [bug](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/16098) that has been around for almost 7 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo print a DataFrame, the function `_pprint_seq()` constructs a string representation of an iterable object (called `seq`) by creating an iterator over it, and truncating it if `len(seq) > max_seq_items`.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, a pandas `DataFrame` is an example of an object where `len(seq)` is _not_ a valid way of checking the length of the iterator. Specifically, `len(df)` returns the number of rows, while `iter(df)` iterates over the columns. When trying to print a DataFrame with more rows than columns, this raises a `StopIterator` exception.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis PR fixes this bug by explicitly iterating over the object, rather than assuming that `len(seq)` is equal to the number of items in the object. The new test `test_nested_dataframe()` raises an exception on `main`, but passes on this branch.\\r\\n\\r\\n- [x] closes #16098\\r\\n- [x] [Tests added and passed](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html#writing-tests).\\r\\n- [x] All [code checks passed](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html#pre-commit).\\r\\n- [ ] Added [type annotations](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html#type-hints) (no new arguments/methods/functions).\\r\\n- [x] Added an entry in `doc/source/whatsnew/v3.0.0.rst`.\\r\\n',\n",

I think the main selling point of `ruff` here is just the ease of implementing new rules, like the currently unenabled `pytest.warns` one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major difference is that `unwanted-patterns-in-tests` is currently only enabled in `pandas/tests` while with this implementation, `TID251` will be enabled globally. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several approaches we can explore to reconcile the 2 behaviors. \\r\\n- Keep it globally enabled for rule where the number of errors is low (and keep using `pygrep`) for the rest\\r\\n- Use [hierarchical configuration](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#pyprojecttoml-discovery) (I think `pandas` doesn't use it at the moment, so this will be a fairly big change)\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's an open issue to track the progress of [flat configuration](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/7696), which allows us to keep all rules within 1 config file, but there's not much progress lately.\",\n",

       "  'body': '### Pandas version checks\\r\\n\\r\\n- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\\r\\n\\r\\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) of pandas.\\r\\n\\r\\n- [ ] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [main branch](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/getting_started/install.html#installing-the-development-version-of-pandas) of pandas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Reproducible Example\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport pandas.tseries.offsets as tso\\r\\na = tso.Second()/10\\r\\nb = tso.Second()*.1\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Issue Description\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast to tso.Minute(), tso.Day(), division with tso.Second() with any integer always results in tso.Day(0) (a). This is not the case with the corresponding multiplication (b).  In previous pandas versions this did not happen. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Expected Behavior\\r\\n\\r\\ntso.Second()/10 should return tso.Milli(100) and not tso.Day(0). \\r\\n\\r\\n### Installed Versions\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : f538741432edf55c6b9fb5d0d496d2dd1d7c2457\\r\\npython                : 3.10.11.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Windows\\r\\nOS-release            : 10\\r\\nVersion               : 10.0.22621\\r\\nmachine               : AMD64\\r\\nprocessor             : Intel64 Family 6 Model 154 Stepping 4, GenuineIntel\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : de_DE.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : de_DE.cp1252\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.0\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.25.2\\r\\npytz                  : 2023.3.post1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 65.5.0\\r\\npip                   : 23.0.1\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : 7.4.0\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : None\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.2\\r\\nIPython               : 8.14.0\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.7.3\\r\\nnumba                 : 0.58.0\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : None\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.11.3\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.19\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2023.3\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",
